- every talkto method should return a Gameobject which has this method 
overridden and in a room returns the collided NPC (== overridden gameobj) 
- if returning a self.talker make sure you do not collide on boxes
- collideup requires a player arg, no more, however the e.g. CommonGO objects
require a room also (commongoobjectsself.collideup(room,player))
- grep for FIX
